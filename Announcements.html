        <h3>Conditions Page Updates</h3>
        <p><strong>March 9th, 2024</strong></p>
        <p>I have made some updates to the Conditions page!</p>
    <p>I decided to keep the same look and feel as before, but wanted to add more options to view Propagation, Weather, and Space.  I went with a tabbed approach and kept the same build out as before with the new addition of the Quick Glance tab.  </p>
      <p>Be sure to browse through the different tabs and check out all the new and exciting datapoints.  You can click on each image to view them in full size.  </p>

        <h3>New Website Launched</h3>
        <p><strong>March 6th, 2024</strong></p>
        <p>Hello! Thank you for stopping by and I am glad you are here!</p>
    <p>I created this website as a front-end for myself, as well as a place to launch some projects and passions of mine.  I plan to use this space to showcase some of my favorite parts of the radio hobby while using it as a vehicle to get out updates of what I might be working on.</p>
<p>This website is mostly static although it is fully custom built and managed.  This is learning opportunity and also a place to have fun!</p>
<p>Getting this website launched has been a big achievement for me.  I now have a launchpad to go off of and I hope to be adding some helpful tools to the radio community!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for being here!</p>
