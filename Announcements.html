        <h3>Info & Traffic Net!</h3>
        <p><strong>September 13th, 2025</strong></p>
        <p>I created a dedicated page for the NCO Info & Traffic net!</p> 
        <p>I haveÂ always enjoyedÂ theÂ KA8VDW North Central Ohio Information and Traffic Net.Â  I found this net right after I got my license and have been checking in ever since.Â Â </p>
        <p>I love the format and topics that the net goes over.  The net covers a large area with multiple repeater locations.</p>
      <p>I wanted to get all the data and information on to one page for everyone so I put this page together for the Info and Traffic Net: <a href="infoandtraffic.html">https://theyug.net/infoandtraffic.html</a></p>
      <p>I will do my best to keep the data as up to date as possible.</p>

        <h3>TheYUG.net for mobile!</h3>
        <p><strong>September 13th, 2025</strong></p>
        <p>I have been wanting to get this feature implemented for a while now.</p> 
        <p>This website should look better on mobile devices now, while maintaining the desktop look and feel I originally went for.</p>
        <p>I am glad I could get this updated because I know some use the websiteÂ more on mobile devices and thingsÂ didn't scale as correctly before.</p>
      <p>Looking forward to making some more updates to the website as well as the Discord server here soon.</p>
      <p>Thanks for reading!</p>

        <h3>The Lunar Eclipse and more!</h3>
        <p><strong>March 14th, 2025</strong></p>
        <p>We got to see the Lunar Eclipse early this morning!</p> 
        <p>Here are some photos that I was able to take.  Sorry for the poor quality as these were taken on my cellphone camera.</p>

          <img src="images/moon3.jpeg" width="300px" height="420px"/></p>
          <p>Looking forward to making some updates to TheYUG Discord server.  We are in the process of adding bots to handle some of the housekeeping as well as adding Roles so people can be notified about club nets.  Stay tuned for when this launches.</p>
      <p>If anyone has any nets they would like added to The Wheel, please send me an email or use the Contact page and we will get the information added to the net list.</p>
      <p>Enjoy the nice radio conditions while we have them and maybe I'll catch you on the air!  73!</p>
      <p>P.S. Happy Pi Day!</p>

        <h3>Merry Christmas & Happy New Year!</h3>
        <p><strong>December 9th, 2024</strong></p>
        <p>Wanted to take the time to wish everyone a very Merry Christmas!</p> 
        <p>As we approach this festive time of year, we wanted to pause and thank everyone for the wonderful friendships we have made through radio.  You are all very special to us.  One of the best things that has come out of this hobby is the connections we have made.</p>
        <p>We are looking forward to the New Year with lots of excitementÂ and wonder.Â  I'm sure it will be a very busy year, and we look forward to sharing it with you all.</p>
        <p>I do have some new ideas for the website, Discord server, and radio in general.  So keep your eyes open for all of that coming later in 2025.</p>
        <p>P.S. I hope everyone enjoys the falling snow :-) </p>

        <h3>The Wheel Enhancements!</h3>
        <p><strong>June 29th, 2024</strong></p>
        <p>We have been gathering a new set of data for the latest update to The Wheel.</p> 
        <p>This is a constant work-in-progress but we have added a bit more information to the Net entries listed on The Wheel.  This includes links if available for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Club</li>
          <li>Repeater Book</li>
          <li>Allstar</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I enjoy having this information listed in one place.  I want to thank Marie - KF8ANS for all her hard work in gathering the data, and building out the links.  She did the heavy lifting :-)</p>
        <p>I also added a new favicon to the page which should be visible next to the website title in your web browser.</p><div style="float:right"><img src="images/TheWheelIcon.png"/></div>
        <p>Some Net names have been shortened and we have introduced tooltips of the full Net name to save space.  Hover over the shortened name to see the full name pop up.</p>
        <p>We hope the newly added links help people find valuable information quickly.  As always, more to come!</p>

        <h3>Field Day 2024 Was Awesome!</h3>
        <p><strong>June 24th, 2024</strong></p>
        <p>It was hot and humid, but we had the best time ever at Field Day!</p> 
        <p>We took part in the joint NOARS and LCARAÂ event.Â  Thank you to both clubs, and everyone that helped make this year's eventÂ a success!</p> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/gceINPi" target="_blank"> <img src="images/FD2.jpg" /></a>
      <p>It was tough in the heat, but we survived and had a good time doing it.  We also ate very well as everyone knows these groups know how to put out some amazing meals.  Hats off to everyone that provided us some amazing nurishment throughout the weekend. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/2dJ1Hr4" target="_blank"><img src="images/FD1.jpg"/></a></p>
      <p>I am already thinking up what I can do to improveÂ for next year.Â  Looking forward to more fun radio days ahead!</p>

        <h3>Arrival of Field Day T-shirt!</h3>
        <p><strong>May 16th, 2024</strong></p>
        <p>Check out our custom T-shirt design for Field Day 2024!</p><div style="float:right"><img src="images/tshirt.png" style="padding-left: 5px;"/></div> 
    <p>I am excited to share with everyone as I have worked very hard on the images and wording used to create this design.  Thrilled to say several have already been ordered!</p>
        <p>Make sure to get a T-shirt!  If you would like to purchase this one of a kind custom T-shirt please, plan on attending either the NOARS meeting on Monday May 20th, or attending the LCARA meeting on Thursday May 24th, 2024 and we can assist you with ordering.  This was a little short notice so the process to order is a bit more tedious than we first anticipated and we expect things to work much easier in the future.</p>
      <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Neither I nor either club are making any money from these orders.  The price is just to have a T-Shirt created and shipped.  Please let us know if you have any questions.</p>

        <h3>Aurora Sighting!</h3>
        <p><strong>May 11th, 2024</strong></p>
        <p>We saw the Northern Lights last night!</p>
    <p>Marie - KF8ANS and I got to see the Aurora Borealis last night!Â  WhatÂ a sight to behold.Â  We both got to witnessÂ a total solarÂ eclipse not long ago, and now the Northern Lights all from our backyard.</p>
        <p>I have included some pictures below that I took using my phone.  I also added an entry to the Links page for the Aurora Forecast.  I hope everyone has a chance to see the Northern Lights again soon!</p>

        <h3>Conditions Page Updates</h3>
        <p><strong>March 9th, 2024</strong></p>
        <p>I have made some updates to the Conditions page!</p>
    <p>I decided to keep the same look and feel as before, but wanted to add more options to view Propagation, Weather, and Space.  I went with a tabbed approach and kept the same build out as before with the new addition of the Quick Glance tab.  </p>
      <p>Be sure to browse through the different tabs and check out all the new and exciting datapoints.  You can click on each image to view them in full size.  </p>

        <h3>New Website Launched</h3>
        <p><strong>March 6th, 2024</strong></p>
        <p>Hello! Thank you for stopping by and I am glad you are here!</p>
    <p>I created this website as a front-end for myself, as well as a place to launch some projects and passions of mine.Â  I plan to use this space to showcaseÂ some of my favorite parts of the radio hobby while using it as a vehicle to get out updates of what I might be working on.</p>
<p>This website is mostly static although it is fully custom built and managed.Â  This is learning opportunity and also a place to have fun!</p>
<p>Getting this website launched has been a big achievement for me.Â  I now have a launchpad to go off of and I hope to be adding some helpful tools to the radio community!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for being here!</p>
